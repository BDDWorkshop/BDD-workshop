## Exercise 4: Red, Green ... Refactor!

By now, the test code is getting a bit messy. It's time to clean up the code.

- order tickets: use a parameter type to pass the ticket type
- refactor: extract logic of available tickets to a separate `AvailableTickets` class
- move repeated steps to background
