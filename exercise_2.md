# Exercise 2: Ticket Queue feature

## Exercise 2a: discover examples

Some examples are already given in the `ticket-queue.feature`. 
Discover some missing examples for the Ticket Queue using an interactive brainstorm or example mapping.

## Exercise 2b: implement examples 

Implement some of these examples for the Ticket Queue feature.

Some inspiration:

- allow more people to buy tickets than there are people in the queue
- you must be removed from the registration queue after being allowed to buy tickets
- after someone is allowed to buy tickets, someone else becomes number 1
- when bypassing the ticket queue, you are not allowed to buy tickets

- extra: total length of the queue
- extra: queue gets empty
